to build GrooveNet under Unix operating system, you should at least have the following libraries installed:

- GCC 4.3 or above (For Mac OS X, GCC is bundled in Xcode. Please install Xcode first)
- libpcap 1.15 (Most Linux distribution have this in software repository. It's availabe on Mac OS X by default) 
- Qt 4 (The latest version Qt 4.7 is preferred)

* Download the source code from https://github.com/mlab/GrooveNet
* cd to the directory
* Perform a qmake
* Perform a make 

Then the binary called ``src'' will be generated by the compiler
