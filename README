Note:
The first time a new map loads the simulator must unpack the tgrXXXXX.zip file and generate a XXXXX.MAP file. This takes a little time (~30 seconds). In the subsequent simulations runs the simulator will start instantly as the .MAP file is already created.

--------------------------------------------------
To make your own simulation test:
If you are looking for an address to map in the major cities, you can try the following by right clicking on the map area once you Autogenerate Vehicles in a new simulation. This will bring up the appropriate map and you can add your vehicles by dragging your mouse over the map.
